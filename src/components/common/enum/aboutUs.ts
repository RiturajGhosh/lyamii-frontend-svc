  "Driven by a shared belief that travel has the power to broaden lifes, and is the key to self exploration, a group of passionate travel enthusiasts from India set out to develop Lyamii, a platform to simplify foreign tourism with pre-loaded vacation chains. Team Lyamii harnessed the power of technology and the love for exploration to create a complete architecture, where an explorer will find numerous portals to new landscapes and cultures.",

  "Lyamii started its journey as a foreign tourism business catering backpacking tours to Southeast Asian countries for fellow Indian solo travellers back in 2023. With love and support from our users we grew stronger and registered ourselves as a Private Limited company in January, 2024. With a completely upgraded JAVA backend on AWS and Microsoft database, Lyamii also has received the tech-startup recognition from the Indian government, DIPP167414. Post recognition Lyamii entered Europe, Africa and Australia, generating more vacation options for Indian backpackers.",

  "With many interactions with foreign travellers visiting India we realised the dynamic energy our country contains, it is very powerful and different. Although visiting India is in the bucket list of almost all global travellers, our guests were lacking a little assistance in order to experience the best of this big country. That is when we started crafting our Incredible India segment. In this segment we've covered all regions of India by connecting diverse cultures with compact itineraries.",

  "Team Lyamii is composed of diverse individuals, from seasoned world travellers, tech heads to active customer support and friendly volunteers, we have assembled a collective of talents who bring unique perspectives and skills to the platform. So far Lyamii has opened two office locations, 18 bootcamps and 64 helpdesks across India. In Lyamii the operations team is more than just a department; it's a commitment to excellence. It has 4 wings and 4 houses. The four wings are Documentation & Verification, Booking & Cancellation, Payment & Refund, Shipment & Warehouse. The wings handle the backend operations, and the houses work on Live Tour Assistance & Problem Solving. Four houses are virtually formed to provide round-the-clock multilingual support to our Users worldwide.",

  "The Travellers Unit of Lyamii carefully curated a selection of tours that take you off the beaten path and allow you to truly immerse yourself in the local culture. Whether you're exploring the ancient ruins of Greece, cruising through the breathtaking landscapes of New Zealand, or traversing the vibrant markets of Egypt, Lyamii vacations offer an authentic and enriching experience that goes beyond typical tourist attractions. We understand that affordability is a crucial factor when it comes to travel. That's why we have worked tirelessly to create partnerships with local businesses, accommodations, and transportation providers in each country, allowing us to offer competitive prices without compromising on quality. Our aim is to make world tourism accessible to everyone, regardless of their budget, so that more people can experience the joy of discovering new places and forging lifelong memories.",
